üîê Password Hashing üõ°Ô∏è

A Python script that performs the following operations:

1. Prompt the user to enter a password.
2. Hash the password using the SHA-256 algorithm.
3. Store the hashed password in a file named hashed_passwords.txt (each new hash
should be appended as a new line).
4. Display the hashed password on the screen.

This Python script securely hashes a user-provided password using the SHA-256
algorithm from the hashlib library. It begins by prompting the user to input a password,
then converts the input string into bytes (since hashing functions require byte input). The
script applies the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to the byte-converted password and
converts the resulting hash into a readable hexadecimal string. It then prints the hashed
password on the screen for verification and appends it to a file named
hashed_passwords.txt, ensuring the hash is stored persistently, with each hashed
password saved on a new line.

üë®‚Äçüíª Codes:

<div class="code-cell">
<code>from hashlib import sha256

\# Prompt user to enter a password
password = input("Enter a password: ")

\# Convert the password into bytes because regular string is not working
password_bytes = password.encode()

\# Hash the password using SHA-256 by converting the hash object into
\# a hexadecimal string
hashed_password = sha256(password_bytes).hexdigest()

\# Print the hashed password to the screen
print("Hashed password:\n" + hashed_password)

\# Save the hashed password to a file
with open("hashed_passwords.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write(hashed_password + "\n")</code>
</div>

<b>Reflection question:</b> Suppose an attacker captures a hashed password and replaces an
existing credential in the database with it. Does this mean they can now log in as another
user? Why or why not? How can we prevent this kind of attack?

<b>Answer:</b> If an attacker captures a hashed password and replaces another user‚Äôs hashed
password in the database with it, they may be able to log in as that user but only if the
system is poorly secured. In simple hash-based authentication systems without unique
salts, this attack can succeed because the system compares the input password (after
hashing) to the stored hash. So, if the attacker knows the password corresponding to the
hash they inserted, they can log in using that password, effectively impersonating the
user whose account was overwritten.
However, properly designed systems use salts unique random values added to each
user's password before hashing which ensures that identical passwords produce different
hashes. This means a hash captured from one account can‚Äôt simply be reused for
another. To prevent this kind of attack, systems should use strong hashing algorithms like
bcrypt or Argon2, enforce per-user salts, and secure credential storage. Additional
safeguards like multi-factor authentication and database integrity checks further reduce
the risk of successful credential tampering.
